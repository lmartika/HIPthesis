Sometimes pdf figures (like the ones you picked up from arXiv source folders) may include fonts that don't get embedded properly in a pdf compled with e.g. pdflatex. For printing with Unigrafia all the fonts need to be embeddid in the document.

Check if everything is alright with pdffonts:

pdffonts document.pdf

The output is something like:

name                                 type              encoding         emb sub uni object ID
------------------------------------ ----------------- ---------------- --- --- --- ---------
NROPUP+CMCSC10                       Type 1            Custom           yes yes no     437  0
EDEFKW+CMR12                         Type 1            Custom           yes yes no     440  0
EXDMPP+CMBX12                        Type 1            Custom           yes yes no     443  0
....

The third column ("emb") tells if the font has been embedded properly. If there's a font with a "no" you can e.g. use ghostscript:

gs -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress -dEmbedAllFonts=true -sOutputFile=docu_embedded.pdf -f document.pdf

The output tells you which pages had fonts that needed to be embedded
